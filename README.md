##### Installation
Installing the skin is easy â€“ Just 2 steps!

1. Overwrite the CSS file by saving this [`manifest.css`](https://raw.github.com/grandchild/Signal-Desktop-Darkskin/master/manifest.css) file in the following location (pick your OS):

 OS  | File Location
--- | -------------
Linux   | `~/.config/chromium/Default/Extensions/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk/0.12.5_0/stylesheets/manifest.css`
Windows | `C:\Users\<Your_User_Name>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions\bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk\0.12.5_0\stylesheets\manifest.css`
Mac     | `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk/0.12.5_0/stylesheets/manifest.css`

1. Restart the Signal app through the menu

##### Uninstall
If you ever want to go back, simply repeat the install steps with the [original `manifest.css`](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Desktop/raw/v0.12.5/stylesheets/manifest.css).

##### Updates
Every time chrome/ium updates your installation of Signal Desktop it will also replace the CSS file. You will then need to reinstall the Darkskin CSS. If there is an update to Signal Desktop and there happens to be no related [release](https://github.com/grandchild/Signal-Desktop-Darkskin/releases) yet, *please do open an issue about it, if there isn't one yet* and I will get to it.


##### Building
Run
```
sass stylesheets/manifest.scss manifest.css
```
